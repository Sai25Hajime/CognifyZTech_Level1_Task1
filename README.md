# CognifyZTech_Level1_Task1
Data Exploration and Preprocessing.

# 🚀 Task Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing as part of my Cognifyz Data Science Internship.

In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on a dataset to ensure data quality and readiness for further analysis.

# 📂 Dataset Details
The dataset contains information about various restaurants, including:

Restaurant names, locations, and cuisines

Ratings, votes, and price range

Online delivery and table booking availability

# 📌 Key Steps & Findings
1️⃣ Dataset Overview
Identified total number of rows and columns.
Checked data types of each column.
2️⃣ Handling Missing Values
Found 9 missing values in the Cuisines column.
Strategy Used: Replaced missing values with "Unknown" since cuisine type is categorical.
3️⃣ Data Type Conversion
Ensured numerical columns were in the correct format.
No major inconsistencies found.
4️⃣ Target Variable Analysis (Aggregate rating)
Distribution Analysis: Identified class imbalance in rating categories.
Found that most restaurants had moderate ratings, with very few having extremely low or high ratings.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

# 📚 What I Learned
✅ Importance of data cleaning and preprocessing before model building.
✅ Handling missing values based on data context.
✅ Identifying class imbalances in a dataset.
✅ Basic data visualization techniques for exploratory analysis.
